<h2>Online Cab Booking system</h2>
<p>Now a days,reaching our destination safely is the biggest challange. So our main aim is to change the mindset of the people and society. Our plan is to increase safety for women.</p>
<p>But due to this covid-19, many of them are not willing to travel in public vehicles. As we want to make sure that we often sanitize our vehicles and clean them regularly.</p>
    <p>We are living in a society, where our modern society had ever seen in terms of women security. We aim to make women feel safe and fight the situations in our society, strong enough to protect themselves against any sexual assault. Our idea is to design a system that will increase the safety of women in this worst situation. India has an abhorrent track record in all forms of sexual exploitation, in homes, on streets, in public transports and even offices. Indian women are in a constant state of vigilance, like a country on terrorist alert. The main motive of building this application is to make women feel safer during their ride in cabs especially night times and increase the participation of women in this current scenario i.e., to increase the employment of a women equally to men and also to make drivers, customers and owners life easy by using Android studio as a platform. If a women is feeling inconvenient with the male driver before she book a cab to travel, she can go with the option female driver from 1)Female 2)Male 3)Any. The female drivers of cabs can accept or reject the booking request according to their convenience, gender, timings. This safety application is only available for female registers. This development in cabs provides security to women all the time and also gives no. of jobs for many women who is willing to do.</p>
